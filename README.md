# turbo-boost-disable

## Why?
My 2018 MacBook Pro runs hot most of the time. 
It's well known that integrated circuits last longer if they are not stressed out as much during their life.
That means (relatively) cool operation most of the time. 
Typing on a warm keyboard is also a deeply unpleasent experience.
I'm willing to have a bit of a hit in performance (about 20%) so that I can have a much nicer time using my computer.

I love [Turbo Boost Switcher (TBS)](https://github.com/rugarciap/Turbo-Boost-Switcher) but was being constantly bombared with at least 3 login prompts every time I unlocked my computer.
There were no workarounds for this as far as I could tell, so I wrote this simple wrapper so I'll never have to see another one of those damn prompts again.

This program runs totally silently in the background and I never have to think about it; the same goes for my MacBook.
It's finally cool, calm, and lasts longer on battery life.

# Install

This is just a shell wrapper around a kext to disable Turbo Boost on 64-bit macOS, taken directly from [TBS](https://github.com/rugarciap/Turbo-Boost-Switcher).

We have to use the direct TBS kext because for some reason, their kext can run on macOS, but we cannot sign our own version to work on macOS. They must have signed it with an Apple key or something?
Anyway, to get around having to use the crappy Turbo-Boost Switcher GUI, we take the core kext, which is directly enabled/disabled with the shell scripts in this repo. Enjoy!

## 1. Setup (Required)

Download the directory and place in your home folder (`~/turbo-boost-disable`).

Create a simple password text file, called `password`.
This is so we don't have to ask for your login password on each login.
This password should be your `sudo` password, which is probably the same as your computer login password.
The file should just be a single line text file with your password included in it.
Place this file at the root of the directory with all the other files.
```sh
yourpasswordhere
```

> #### ðŸ›‘  IMPORTANT  ðŸ›‘
> This means your password will be stored in plaintext in this directory within the `password` file. 
> Ensure that only people that know the `sudo` password are users of the computer where this tool is enabled.

Make all the scripts executable:
```sh
$ chmod +x *{.sh,.exp}
```

You can now choose automatic control or manual control to disable Turbo Boost.

## 2a. Automatic Control (suggested)
To ensure Turbo Boost is always disabled, we need to run `start.sh` every time the computer is unlocked.
This is because after unlock the kext will stop working (for some reason).

You can choose to do this yourself manually, but good luck remembering to do that every time.

This can be easily automated on macOS.
For example, I recommend using `sleepwatcher`, a good tool for running scripts after lock/unlock on macOS.
To install `sleepwatcher`, just use homebrew and start the service:
```sh
$ brew install sleepwatcher
$ brew services start sleepwatcher
```

Then create the wakeup script file at `~/.wakeup`:
```sh
$ touch ~/.wakeup
$ chmod +x ~/.wakeup
$ echo "#!/bin/sh" >> ~/.wakeup
$ echo "./turbo-boost-disable/start.sh" >> ~/.wakeup
```

This will be called each time the computer is unlocked, and works well (for me at least).

## 2b. Manual Control (if you want)
These scripts probably require a `sudo` password on each run, but are useful for one-off enables or disables.

Disable Turbo Boost:
```sh
./load.sh
```

Enable Turbo Boost:
```sh
./unload.sh
```

Bear in mind that after enabling, it probably will auto-disable after the next computer unlock.
You should use the Automatic Control directions to ensure that Turbo Boost is always disabled.
